	<h2 class="sec01">What to Expect</h2>
	<p>Because of our mixed ethnic heritages, friends have asked what traditional elements we are planning to incorporate. We would like to decode the mystery for you before our big day.</p>

	<p>Ceremony attendees will see a fairly typical North American wedding. We <i>will</i> incorporate some Kerala Christian wedding traditions into the ceremony, but these do not include the more well-known elements from other regions in India. Sorry - no white horses, no elephants, no henna party!</p>

	<p>The two receptions will be loosely themed based on our backgrounds: a formal American dinner in Salt Lake City, and a colourful Indian reception in the Toronto area. No matter which party you attend, expect to dance your soles off!</p>



	<h1 class="sec02">Salt Lake City</h1>
	<p>Site of the 2002 Winter Olympics, Christopher's hometown, and Sunita's favourite American city, Salt Lake City has a ton to offer visitors! We are so excited to share it with you, and we hope you come back in winter to experience the <a href="http://24saltlake.com/utah-snow-infographic/">greatest snow on earth.</a></p>

	<h2 class="sec02">Hotel Accommodations</h2>
	<p>Our wedding guests can take advantage of a discounted courtesy rate of $99 USD, available from June 2-6 at:</p>

	<blockquote>
	Hyatt House Downtown Salt Lake City<br/>
	140 South 300 West, SLC

	<h2 class="sec02">AirbnB / VRBO</h2>
	<p>For those who prefer to stay in a vacation rental property, there are several reasonably-priced <a href="airbnb.com">airbnb</a> and <a href="vrbo.com">VRBO</a> properties.

	<h2 class="sec02">Transportation</h2>
	<p>Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) is a convenient and efficient airport to fly in and out of the city. There are few ways to get downtown from the airport, and vice versa.</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>Light rail ("TRAX"): There is a "Green line" TRAX stop at the airport. A ride into the city will cost $2.50 and takes 7-10 stops, depending on where you are staying. This is the cheapest way of getting downtown.</li>
	 <li>Lyft/Uber: a Lyft will cost about $15 to go from the airport to downtown. Uber rates will depend on demand.</li>
	 <li>Taxi: There is a taxi stand outside the terminal. A ride into the city will cost around $20.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For getting around town, here are some alternatives to driving:</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>Walk! Downtown SLC is very walkable, especially when the weather is just right. Wear comfortable shoes, and be prepared for some uphill inclines if you are staying in the Avenues.</li>
	 <li><a href="http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=UTA-Home-TRAX">TRAX</a> is a fast and convenient way to get around as well. There is a free fare zone in the downtown core. Otherwise, single rides cost $2.50. The University, Airport, Sugarhouse, and multiple sports and entertainment venues are accessible by TRAX.</li>
	 <li><a href="https://greenbikeslc.org/">SLC GREENbike</a> is another healthy way to get from point A to point B while in the city. You can get a short-term membership (24hr for $5 or 4 day for $15), and check out bikes for 30min at a time for no additional charge. There are <a href="https://greenbikeslc.org/station-map">bike stations all over downtown</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="sec02">Tip: Deciphering Addresses</h2>
    <p>If you find some of the addresses listed here confusing, here is the secret: Salt Lake City is laid out on a grid, and many of our addresses are basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system">Cartesian coordinates</a>. If math class is a distant memory for you, feel free to skip this section, and call us if you get lost. But, for the geometrically-minded, the SLC grid means that you will rarely, if ever, need a GPS locator while visiting.</p>

    <p>The Salt Lake LDS Temple is the origin of our city grid. The x- and y- axes are South Temple and Main Street, respectively. </p>
<center>
<img src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?size=300x300&center=40.769283,-111.89099&path=color:blue%7Cweight:5%7C40.769455,-111.899781%7C40.769332,-111.882583&path=color:blue%7Cweight:5%7C40.776687,-111.891129%7C40.762938,-111.890901"/></center>

    <p>For example, 140 S 200 W is a block and a half south, and two blocks west of the Temple. (Some of our streets are named, not numbered, so you will still have to exercise your map-reading skills to arrive at the Natural History Museum of Utah, 301 Wakara Way for our SLC reception.) </p> 


	<h2 class="sec02">The Sights</h2>
	<p>This little city, nestled between the Wasatch Mountains to the east and the Oquirrhs to the west, has a lot of beauty and a laid-back vibe. We invite you to spend some time exploring the everyday charms of our home.</p>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Temple Square</b> is an important tourist destination here. The gardens will be in full bloom come June, and you can tour the Visitor's Centers, located North and South of the big LDS Temple, to learn about the religion headquartered here in SLC.</li>

	<li>Fans of choral music can attend a <a href="http://www.mormontabernaclechoir.org/events/music-and-the-spoken-word.html">free, live broadcast of the <b>Mormon Tabernacle Choir</b> performing</a> every Sunday morning, at the Conference Center. Doors open at 8:30am, but we recommend arriving early. </li>

	<li>Salt Lake City has a thriving outdoors sports & recreation scene. <b>Hikers</b> of all skill levels can find a trail to suit their interests: City Creek Canyon is easily accessible from downtown, but Millcreek, Big Cottonwood and Little Cottonwood Canyon will reward you with fabulous views.</li>

	<li>Ski season may be over, but nearby <b>Park City</b> is still worth a visit. Utah Olympic Park, one of the sites used for the 2002 Winter Olympics, is now a training center for Olympic and other athletes. You might see ski jumpers rehearsing in the summer splash pool next to the Joe Quinney Winter Sports Center. There are good bike trails, and plenty of rental options for mountain and road bikers. Afterwards, head to Main Street for a bite and a beverage to close out your day.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1 class="sec03">Toronto</h1>
	<p>Toronto is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world, Canada's most populous city, and where the rest of the Chackos still reside. We are thrilled that we can bring the party to the 6ix and we welcome our American family to the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).</p>

	<h2 class="sec03">Hotel Accommodations</h2>

	<p>We have a couple of downtown hotel options for visitors to Toronto. Both properties are located near a subway station for ease of transportation.</p>

	<h2 class="sec03">Transportation</h2>
	<p>There are two airports you can fly into:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Toronto Pearson International (YYZ) is your most likely destination option when searching for flights from most American cities. It is actually located in Mississauga, a western suburb of Toronto. The easiest way to get to downtown Toronto from Pearson, is to take the <a href="http://www.torontopearson.com/en/toandfrom/upexpress/"> Union Pearson ("UP") Express</a> train. The ride takes 25 minutes, and there are trains departing every 15min. A one-way fare costs under $30 CAD.</li>
	<li>Visitors from major east-coast American cities may find flights going to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (YTZ), also known as the Toronto Island Airport. It is located on the Toronto Islands, near downtown Toronto. There are <a href="http://www.portstoronto.com/Airport/Getting-To.aspx">several options</a> to get to and from the Island Airport from downtown.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once you are here, you can take advantage of public transit options to get around town. Here are some terms to know:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>TTC, or the Toronto Transit Commission, operates the city's public transit network - comprising of <a href="http://www.ttc.ca/Subway/index.jsp">subway lines</a>, streetcars and buses. This is a great way to get around Toronto.</li>
	<li>GO Transit is the inter-region public transit service (think commuter rail and bus lines). When traveling from Toronto to Mississauga, a GO train and a short cab/Uber ride will be your most convenient and economical option.</li>
	<li>PRESTO is the electronic fare payment system used across the various transit agencies in the GTA. After loading cash onto your PRESTO card, you can use it on the UP Express, TTC and GO Transit, among others. Fares are often discounted for PRESTO card users, so it's worth using one.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Uber operates in Toronto and Mississauga, but Lyft is still US-only. Taxis are plentiful.</p>

	<h2 class="sec03">What to Do and See</h2>
	<p>Like every major city in North America, Toronto has enough going on to satisfy the most discerning of visitors. Here are some highlights:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>The CN tower, the world's tallest tower until 2010, is impossible to miss. You can buy a pass to ride up the tower ($32-$64 CAD) and even take an open-air, hands-free walk around the edge of the Tower's main pod ($164 CAD).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.hhof.com/">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>: guests on both sides of our family have asked about the HHOF, so here's the scoop - Located in downtown Toronto, a short walk from either Union Station or the King subway stop. Visit the Stanley Cup and hockey's greats for only $18. (Be sure to check the hours of operation.)</li>
	<li>First-time visitors to Ontario should not miss out on Niagara Falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Approximately a 90 min drive from downtown Toronto, the Falls are most impressive when viewed from the Canadian side. While in the region, visit a winery in Niagara-on-the-Lake and try the region's specialty: ice wine.</li>
	<li>Toronto Harbour provides a scenic location to walk, have some lunch, or take a boat cruise that offers a spectacular view of the Toronto skyline.</li>
	<li>The artists in our family may enjoy visiting the largest collection of Canadian art at the Art Gallery of Ontario. The gallery features Group of Seven landscapes, an awesome collection of Inuit art, as well as works by the greats - from Ruben to van Gogh to Picasso to Warhol.</li>
	<li>Besides the sights above, there are a number of events to consider (music, comedy, theatre, Blue Jays baseball) and neighbourhoods (Chinatown, the Distillery District, Kensington Market, Yorkville) where you can shop, eat, and drink.</li>
	</ul>
